### Basic Flow
1. get Playlist metadata after going through brain melting cookie, token stuff.
2. hit pytube with search.
3. get the title, sort, filter based on 'version' etc
4. download the youtube streams as mp4.
5. zip mp4
6. extract mp3 from mp4 using ffmpeg, zipIt-shipIt.

TODO:
Get better with the cookie and auth, its abomination rn.
